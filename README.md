# 🏬 MiniAppStore

A simple collection of small Java applications developed by me.
Each app is packaged as a runnable `.jar` file for easy download and use.

---

## 📌 Overview

MiniAppStore acts as a personal hub where I upload the Java apps I build.
All apps are lightweight, easy to run, and designed for quick testing, learning, or utility use.
More apps will be added over time as the collection grows.

## 📦 Features

* A central place for all my Java applications
* Runnable `.jar` files — no extra setup needed
* Simple and clean project structure
* Easy to expand with new apps

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure you have **Java (JRE or JDK)** installed on your system.

### Run from terminal:

```
java -jar <AppName>.jar
```

### Or double-click:

Most systems allow you to run the JAR by simply double-clicking it.

A small tool to calculate the area of different shapes such as squares, rectangles, circles, and more.

### 2. **SqlEmployeeManagementSystem.jar**

A simple employee management system using SQL for basic CRUD operations.

*(More apps will be added as I create them.)*

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Java**
* **JAR Packaging**
* **SQL (for apps that require a database)**
